  <h1> TIGER </h1> 
  <!--ტექსტი ვეფხვის შესახებ -->
  <p>Tiger, (Panthera tigris), largest
     member of the cat family (Felidae),
    rivaled only by the lion (Panthera 
    leo) in strength and ferocity. The
     tiger is endangered throughout its
     range, which stretches from the Russian
     Far East through parts of North Korea, 
    China, India, and Southeast Asia to the 
     Indonesian island of Sumatra. The Siberian
    , or Amur, tiger (P. tigris altaica) is the
     largest, measuring up to 4 metres (13 feet) 
      in total length and weighing up to 300 kg (660 pounds)
     . The Indian, or Bengal, tiger (P. tigris tigris) is the
  
     most numerous and accounts for about half of the total tiger
     population. Males are larger than females and may attain a 
     shoulder height of about 1 metre and a length of about 2.2 
     metres, excluding a tail of about 1 metre; weight is 160–230
     kg (350–500 pounds), and tigers from the south are
    smaller than those of the north.</p>

     <h1>  Whale  </h1>
     <!-- ვეშაპი -->
    <p>Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully 
       aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping
       thin the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and 
       porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order
      Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their
       closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having
       diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders 
       of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales 
       (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34
       million years ago. Whales consist of eight extant 
       families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae 
       (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale)
      , Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae
       (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale),
         Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and 
       Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).</p>

    <h1> Etymology and definitions </h1>
       <p>
         The word "whale" comes from the Old
         English hwæl, from Proto-Germanic 
         *hwalaz, from Proto Indo European 
         *(s)kwal-o-, meaning "large sea fish".
        [2][3] The Proto-Germanic *hwalaz is also 
         the source of Old Saxon hwal, Old Norse hvalr,
         hvalfiskr, Swedish val, Middle Dutch wal, walvisc,
         Dutch walvis, Old High German wal, and German Wal
         .[2] The obsolete "whalefish" has a similar derivation,
              indicating a time when whales were thought to be fish.
          [citation needed] Other archaic English forms include 
          wal, wale, whal, whalle, whaille, wheal, etc.[4]
